### **Description**  
As AI systems grow more complex and influential, the need for transparency, accountability, and trust becomes paramount. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this challenge by bridging the gap between advanced algorithms and human understanding, ensuring that AI models are not just powerful but also interpretable and trustworthy.  

In this session, we will unravel the mysteries of XAI, diving into techniques that go beyond conventional AI methods. We‚Äôll explore how to make black-box models more transparent and examine the ethical implications of AI decision-making. From interpretability methods and model diagnostics to real-world applications, this session offers a comprehensive overview of XAI‚Äôs impact today and its potential for the future.  

Whether you are an AI professional, researcher, developer, or simply curious about the field, this session will provide you with the tools and insights needed to build responsible AI systems that align with human values and inspire trust.
